# Memorization

Goal: turn your Top 20 into muscle memory without burning out.

## Daily (5–7 min)
- Review one app's **Top 20** table.
- Close the tab and try to recall from memory.
- Reopen and fill gaps.

## Weekly (15–25 min)
- Add 2–3 new items per app.
- Remove anything you never actually use.

## Hooks
- Make shortcuts *visual* (e.g., "H = left" in Vim movement).
- Create a 3–5 step **workflow** and practice it end-to-end.
