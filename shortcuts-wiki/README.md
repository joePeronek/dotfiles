# Shortcuts Wiki

A lightweight Markdown framework for documenting your app shortcuts, remaps, and workflows. 
Optimized for Obsidian/VS Code/Neovim markdown workflows (wiki links `[[like-this]]` + `#tags`).

- **Start here:** Open `INDEX.md` and add or remove apps.
- **Template:** Duplicate anything in `templates/` to add a new page.
- **Tags:** Use a few broad tags like `#macOS`, `#linux`, `#editor`, `#terminal`, `#window-manager`.
- **Front matter:** Optional YAML used for automation and sorting.

## Suggested workflow
1. Pick one app you use daily.
2. Copy `templates/app.md` to `apps/<app>.md` and fill the top sections.
3. Add 10â€“20 "Top 20" shortcuts you want to memorize.
4. Add conflicts and remaps (esp. between apps).
5. Practice from `memorization.md` with spaced repetition.

## Tools you might like later (optional)
- Static site: mkdocs / obsidian / quartz (no need to set these up now).
- Git + chezmoi: version and sync with your dotfiles.

Happy key-smashing!
